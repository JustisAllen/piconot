## Running commentary

_Describe each change from your ideal syntax to the syntax you implemented, and
describe_ why _you made the change._

We got into the IDE and immediately realized that things were going to be harder than we thought they would be. We  went through various discussions of what would be objects,classes, and operators and eventually settled on a compromise of where to start. We changed to:

'rule( # seq ) -> action' which is pretty different but we're planning to slim down significantly by removing the need for the rule keyword.

Yikes. We're figuring out how we want to pass our arguments to rule and so far the only way we can see to do that is as a list. This isn't ideal but hopefully we'll be able to make it better. End day 1 
## On a scale of 1–10 (where 10 is "a lot"), how much did you have to change your syntax? 

## On a scale of 1–10 (where 10 is "very difficult"), how difficult was it to map your syntax to the provided API?
